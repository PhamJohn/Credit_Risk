# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 
This project examines the appplication of Machine Learning Algorithms to evaluate credit risk for personal loans. The results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms are then interpreted.

# Summary
Based on the abaove analysis I would recommend using the Easy Ensemble Classifier Model to determine the credit risks as it shows the highest accuracy score of 93%. This method was able to classify the highest percentage of accurate cases, while also being able to accurately identify the high risk cases. After this analysis the front runner for perfomring these types of analysis most accurately should be the EasyEnsambleClassifier.
